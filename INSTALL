To install:

  + You must have first installed the qt-5 and poppler libraries,
    including the poppler-qt5 library. These may be available packaged
    for your platform or the sources can be obtained from:

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads#qt-lib
http://poppler.freedesktop.org/

  + Edit vprerex.pro so INCLUDEPATH and LIBS point to the 
    relevant directories.

  + qmake vprerex.pro (using the qt-5 qmake)

  + make

  + install the vprerex binary in a suitable directory such as
    $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin.

If vprerex is applied to a LaTeX file, it calls xterm and the prerex
editor.
