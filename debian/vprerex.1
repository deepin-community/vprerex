.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vprerex 
(visual prerex) is a GUI front-end and viewer for the
.BR prerex (1)
interactive editor
of prerequisite-chart descriptions in the
.BR prerex (5)
format.
The viewer may be used just as a minimalistic viewer of arbitrary PDF files  but
supports editing of charts 
generated using
.BR prerex.sty (7)
by allowing coordinates of course boxes, arrows,
and background points to be conveyed back to the 
.BR prerex (1)
command-line using the clipboard.
.SH USAGE
If 
.B vprerex
is invoked on a PDF file, it simply displays that file.
.PP
If the (first) argument 
does 
.I not 
have the .pdf
suffix, it is assumed to be the base file for a LaTeX document
containing a prerequisite-chart description 
in
.BR prerex (5)
format, to be edited using
.BR prerex (1).
If a 
.I second
argument
is supplied, it is regarded as an included file containing
the specific chart environment to be edited.
.PP
If 
.I no
arguments are supplied, a file-opening dialog
allows the user the specify the 
.BR prerex (1)
base file
to be edited (or the PDF file to be viewed); if a separate chartfile is needed,
.BR vprerex (1)
must be invoked wth two arguments on the command line.
.PP
If the mouse hovers over a hyperlink in the PDF viewing window, the cursor shape will
change to a pointing finger and a tooltip will display the URI.
If the PDF file displayed contains 
a chart generated using
.BR prerex.sty (7)
and the background coordinate grid has been enabled, 
left-clicking the mouse on a course box, arrow mid-point, or background point
will load the relevant coordinates 
into the X clipboard.
The cursor shape changes to a plus-sign to indicate
successful capture of the coordinates.
Middle-clicking the mouse at the
.BR prerex (1)
command-line will then paste those coordinates into a command being composed.
If the chart file is regenerated,
the updated document will be re-loaded.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B vprerex
is based on the Qt-4 library. It
calls
.BR xterm (1)
and
.BR prerex (1)
for the editing window and
uses 
.BR poppler-qt4
for rendering PDF files.
