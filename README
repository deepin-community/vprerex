vprerex (visual prerex) is a GUI front-end and viewer for the prerex
interactive editor of prerequisite-chart descriptions in the prerex
format. The viewer may be used just as a minimalist viewer of arbitrary
PDF files but supports editing of charts generated using prerex.sty by
allowing coordinates of course boxes, arrows, and background points
to be conveyed back to the prerex editor command-line using the X11
clipboard.

To install:

  + You must have first installed the qt-5 and poppler libraries,
    including the poppler-qt5 library. These may be available packaged
    for your platform or the sources can be obtained from:

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads#qt-lib
http://poppler.freedesktop.org/

  + Edit vprerex.pro so INCLUDEPATH and LIBS point to the 
    relevant directories.

  + qmake vprerex.pro (using the qt-4 qmake)

  + make

  + install the vprerex binary in a suitable directory such as
    $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin.

If vprerex is applied to a LaTeX file, it calls xterm and the prerex
editor.
